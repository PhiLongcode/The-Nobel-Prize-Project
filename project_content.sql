(25, 175, 'Marie Curie was a Polish scientist and the first woman to win the Nobel Prize. She is the only person in history to have won Nobel Prizes in two different fields: Physics and Chemistry. She was born in 1867 and passed away in 1934.\nMarie Curie is renowned for her research on radioactivity and the discovery of two important elements: polonium and radium. Together with her husband, Pierre Curie, she conducted groundbreaking studies on radiation and developed tools for measuring radioactivity. This opened up a new field in science and contributed to our understanding of atomic structure and X-rays.\nFor her significant contributions, Marie Curie received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, which she shared with her husband and Antoine Henri Becquerel. She later received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911. She became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and remains the only person to have received the honor in two different disciplines.\nMarie Curie\'s achievements are not only remarkable in terms of scientific advancements but also in overcoming social barriers for women in the scientific field. She became an icon for women in research and scientific exploration.', NULL, 'From childhood she was remarkable for her prodigious memory, and at the age of 16 she won a gold medal on completion of her secondary education at the Russian lycée. Because her father, a teacher of mathematics and physics, lost his savings through bad investment, she had to take work as a teacher and, at the same time, took part clandestinely in the nationalist “free university,” reading in Polish to women workers. At the age of 18 she took a post as governess, where she suffered an unhappy love affair. From her earnings she was able to finance her sister Bronisława’s medical studies in Paris, with the understanding that Bronisława would in turn later help her to get an education.', 'Marie Curie\'s scientific career began with her research on radioactivity, a term that she coined herself. Together with her husband Pierre Curie, she conducted extensive experiments on uranium rays and discovered new radioactive elements, including polonium and radium. Their groundbreaking work paved the way for advancements in atomic science.\nIn 1903, Marie Curie became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing it with Pierre Curie and Antoine Henri Becquerel. This recognition solidified her reputation as a pioneering scientist. Following Pierre\'s tragic death in 1906, Marie Curie continued their research and became the first female professor at the University of Paris.\nIn 1911, Marie Curie received her second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, in recognition of her discovery and isolation of pure radium. She remains the only person to have received Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.\nThroughout her career, Marie Curie faced significant challenges due to her gender. However, her passion, perseverance, and remarkable contributions to science broke barriers and inspired generations of scientists, especially women, to pursue careers in the field. She left an indelible legacy as a brilliant scientist and a symbol of female empowerment in science.', '- Gender Discrimination: Marie Curie lived in a time when women were severely underrepresented in the scientific community. She faced discrimination and prejudice due to her gender, which limited her access to educational opportunities and professional recognition. Despite these obstacles, she persisted and made groundbreaking contributions to science.\n- Limited Educational Opportunities: As a young woman in Poland, Marie Curie faced restricted access to higher education. She attended an underground university and later moved to France to study at the Sorbonne. Financial constraints and language barriers added to her difficulties, but she overcame them through dedication and hard work.\n- Financial Hardships: Marie Curie struggled with financial instability, especially during her early years as a student and researcher. She often had to support herself through tutoring and suffered from poverty. However, she persevered, securing scholarships and grants that allowed her to continue her scientific pursuits.\n- Balancing Personal Life and Scientific Career: Marie Curie juggled her personal and professional responsibilities. She married Pierre Curie in 1895 and became a mother to two daughters. Balancing family commitments while pursuing her scientific research posed additional challenges. Tragically, she became a widowed single mother following Pierre\'s untimely death in 1906.\n- Health Risks from Radioactivity: Marie Curie\'s pioneering research on radioactivity exposed her to significant health risks. At the time, the dangers of radiation were not fully understood. She worked with radioactive materials without adequate protection, which ultimately led to her developing health issues, including radiation-induced illnesses.', '1867 Born in Warsaw, Poland.\n1893-94 Earned math and physics degrees at the Sorbonne in Paris. Started writing a doctoral thesis on radiation. It had been discovered in 1896 by Antoine Henri Becquerel.\n1895 Married physicist Pierre Curie, head of the laboratory at the School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry in Paris. Joined him in his work there.\n1896-1903 Measured radiation levels emitted by various compounds. Discovered two substances that emitted more radiation than would be expected. In 1898, concluded that one of them contained an unknown radioactive element. Pierre Curie joined his wife in conducting research. Together, the pair discovered two new radioactive elements. They named the elements polonium (after Poland) and radium. Their work then focused on identify their chemical properties.\n1897 Gave birth to her first daughter, Irene.\n1903 Earned her doctorate, based on the work described in her thesis, Radio-Active Substances. With her husband and Becquerel, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n1904 Gave birth to her second daughter, Eve. Pierre Curie named a professor at the Sorbonne.\n1906 After her husband was killed by a truck on a Paris street, assumed his position at the Sorbonne. Became the first female lecturer in the 750-year history of the university. Also assumed charge of the Sorbonne lab.\n1908 Promoted to Professor at the Sorbonne.\n1911 Awarded a second Nobel Prize for Chemistry, for isolating pure radium.\n1914-1918 During World War I, developed X-rays for use in medicine.\n1918-1934 Became director of the scientific department of the Radium Institute. Joined by her daughter Irene Joliot-Curie and husband Frederic Joliot. Continued to research the chemistry of radioactive materials and their medical applications. Lectured internationally. Established scholarships for scientists.\n1934 Died of leukemia, likely due to prolonged exposure to radiation during her lifetime.\n1935 Daughter Irene Joliot-Curie and Frederic Joliot received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nJoliot-Curie’s daughter became a nuclear physicist and their son a biochemist, both making significant scientific contributions.

What happens to one of the particles in an entangled pair determines what happens to the other particle, even if they are far apart. In 1981–1982, Alain Aspect conducted groundbreaking experiments using entangled light particles, photons. These and other experiments confirm that quantum mechanics is correct and pave the way for quantum computers, quantum networks and quantum encrypted communication.', 'One of the main criticisms of Aspect\'s work on quantum entanglement is related to the interpretation of his experimental results. Some scientists have argued that his experiments do not necessarily prove the existence of non-locality, but rather suggest the presence of hidden variables that could explain the correlations observed in the experiments. This debate about the interpretation of quantum mechanics has been ongoing for decades and remains a topic of active research and discussion in the physics community.\nIn addition, some scientists have raised concerns about the methods used in Aspect\'s experiments on quantum entanglement. For example, some have suggested that the detectors used in his experiments may have introduced errors or biases that could have affected the results. Others have questioned whether the experiments were truly capable of ruling out all possible alternative explanations for the observed correlations.\nDespite these criticisms, Aspect\'s work on quantum entanglement remains highly influential and has had a significant impact on our understanding of quantum mechanics and the nature of reality at the most fundamental level.
